## üéØ Project Overview

- Engine: Unreal Engine 4
- Language: C++
- Genre: First-Person Shooter (FPS)
- Project Type: Independent / Solo
- Focus: C++ gameplay programming, Enemy AI, UE4 architecture

---

## ‚ú® Features

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Contributions

As the sole developer of this project, I focused on deepening my understanding of Unreal Engine‚Äôs C++ API and AI framework.

### Key Implementations:

- Player Controller & Pawn: Built FPS movement, camera control, and weapon firing systems entirely in C++
- Enemy AI: Designed and implemented AI behavior using:
  - Behavior Trees for logic flow
  - Blackboard for data-driven decisions
  - C++ AI Controller for custom enemy behavior
- Gameplay Systems: Created health, damage, and respawn systems using UE4‚Äôs gameplay framework

## üîß Technical Highlights

- C++ Focus: Minimized Blueprint usage to strengthen C++ skills within UE4
- AI System: Used UE4‚Äôs AI modules including `BehaviorTree`, `BTService`, `BTTask`, and `AIController`
- Architecture: Followed UE4 best practices with `UObject`, `AActor`, and component-based design
